# How to contribute


## Translations

## Code

### Branches

Please avoid working directly on the `master` branch.

We use [Git Flow](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow) to manage our branches. It means that the master branch is always clean and pointing to the latest public release.

So thank you to make your pull requests on the `develop` branch instead of `master`.


### During the development

Don't forget to run the Webpack based watcher by typing this command:

    $ npm run watch

You can run the tests by runnning:

    $ npm test
